# opus5_calendar


## Description 

Many people in business today have a very busy daily schedule. This application can be used in a browser to save events for each hour of the day. It is powered by jQuery, and uses Moment.js to track the time. 

This application has timeblocks for every hour of the work day. Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it represents a timeblock in the past, in the present, or the future.
